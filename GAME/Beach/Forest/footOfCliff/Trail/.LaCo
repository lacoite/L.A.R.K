╚══════╝: You found a holo-scroll! These are a form of technology used to document important messages. Read it then add it to your inventory. There may be more in other locations. It looks like some of the data has been lost, but I wonder if we can find a way to translate what's left.

GAME HINT: If you are unsure how to add items to your inventory, you may need to explore other areas first. Use the function "LaCo" to view all of your commands. If that doesn't help, use cd .. to go back to an earlier location.
