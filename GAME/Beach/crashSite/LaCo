╚══════╝: You should see if there is anything salvageable from the crash.
Interact with the wreckage by using the source command ".". Use this command on anything that is light green and begins with a "~". These are called scripts.
Things that you can pick up and add to your inventory will be the default color of your text, but will begin with a "+". Add them to your inventory by using the mv command.
When you're all done, use the command cd .. to go back to the Beach.

Remember that you can just type my name to call my function if you want to see your old commands and information!
